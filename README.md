  <summary>A little bit of backstory:</summary>
  
  Roughly around 2014 i started to mess around with forum softwares like myBB/phpBB/xenforo/etc. and at some point i started making similar 
  app with some basic HTML and PHP, and then proceeded to make apps like directory management and api for user authenticating something that i'd forgotten about. 
  It's already been at least 6 years since the last time i ever touched PHP.

  2015 was when i started liking minecraft, playing around single player and some cracked multiplayer servers like teamextrememc, exgm, craftrealms, etc.
  Not until 2017 that i started hosting some of my own minecraft servers (tho they were never opened to the public)
  and there i got interested in bukkit plugin development and started learning java to write my own plugins. It was rough at first but i did
  manage to make around 3-4 plugins which only one left exist in my private gitlab repo

  Some interesting websites caught my attenion around 2018 and there i started learning some more basic HTML/CSS/JS. I ended up making a log parser for minecraft,
  copied (as in reusing one's design, not stealing code) a minecraft server web frontend (that didn't go well to a server co-owner at the time so i had to
  take it down) and a personal interactable website with a music player, visualizer, key shortcuts and other things. 
  It was probably my most ambiguos and hell-ish project i made but sadly i wasn't able to retrieve its source code due to unknown reasons.
  
  As for typescript (or javascript), i just noticed nodejs being very popular lately so i kinda learned it ~~half-heartedly~~ for no reason at all, 
  and my first node app was a bot for discord apparently.
  
  For the rest, i learned Kotlin while partaking classes about mobile app dev (they teached in Java but i went with Kotlin instead).
  And for C# - it is a requirement for learning on how to use the Unity engine.
